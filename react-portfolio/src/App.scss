/* A SCSS (Sassy CSS) file is a file written in the SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) preprocessor language. SASS is a scripting language that is interpreted 
or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SCSS is a syntax extension of SASS and is fully compatible with CSS syntax, making it easier for developers to transition 
from traditional CSS to SASS.

$primary-color: #3498db;

body {
  background-color: $primary-color;
}

SCSS supports the use of partials, which are smaller SCSS files that can be included in other SCSS files. This helps organize styles into manageable and modular components.
// _buttons.scss
.button {
  // styles for buttons
}

// main.scss
@import 'buttons';

body {
  // other styles
}
