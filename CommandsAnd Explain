In a React project, a .prettierrc file is used to configure the formatting rules for your code using Prettier, a popular code formatter. Prettier helps maintain a consistent
 coding style across your project by automatically formatting your code according to the specified rules.

 JSON doesn't allow comments so adding .pretteirrc below
 /*
trailingComma: Specifies how trailing commas should be handled. In this case, "es5" means that trailing commas will be used wherever valid in ES5 (ECMAScript 5) code.

tabWidth: Sets the number of spaces for each indentation level. In this case, it's set to 2 spaces.

semi: Specifies whether to add a semicolon at the end of each statement. In this case, false means that no semicolons will be added.

singleQuote: Enforces the use of single quotes for strings. Setting it to true means that strings will be enclosed in single quotes.
